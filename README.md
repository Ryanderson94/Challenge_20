# PyChain Ledger

In this Challenge, we developed code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. We assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

This application allows users to review a list of candidates, select from said list, 'hire them' and effectively pay them. This is facilitated by integrating directly with with Ethereum Blockchain.
