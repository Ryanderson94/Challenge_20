# Personal Savings with Blockchain

In this Challenge, we facilitate the automated creation of joint savings accounts, by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies

This program leverages Solidity 0.5.17.

## Installation Guide

As this challenge leverages Remix IDE, a web-based tool as well as GitHub, there are no installations required. Simply copy the code from the joint_savings.sol file into a new file in the Remix IDE (remix.ethereum.org). Once this is done:
1. Compile the Code

**NOTE:** _This is a perfect illustration of why it is important to use the SmartMaths functions as we have technically overdrawn from the account as a result of the gas fees._
