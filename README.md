# PyChain Ledger

In this Challenge, we facilitate the automated creation of joint savings accounts, by creating a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

# Technologies

This program leverages Solidity 0.5.17.

## Installation Guide

As this challenge leverages Remix IDE, a web-based tool as well as GitHub, there are no installations required. That said, the following instructions outline how to connect your GitHub to Remix, how to compile and deploy the smart contract and finally, how to use it.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the directory in either the Terminal or GitBash. 

2. Run the following command: streamlit run fintech_finder.py

4. Enter details into the Sender ID, Receiver ID, Amount and click the 'Add Block' button. This will add a block to the ledger. This can be validated in two ways: the new block will appear as a new row in the PyChain ledger dataframe and secondly, will appear under the Block Inspector dropdown.
